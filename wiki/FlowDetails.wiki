==Launcher==
1. Check if there is any downloaded patches recorded in client script. If there isn't any, launch the software.
2. Start patching. Do patching and store the patched and newly created files temporaily in the <b>update</b> folder.
3. Do replacement/movement on all files using the files stored in the<b>update</b> folder. If there is more patches to apply, go to step 2 and do patching.
4. If there is any file patching failed due to file locking, use the [Overview#3.4._Self-Updater Self-Updater] to do patching on those files.
5. Validate all files to make sure the client has all the files that the software needs.
6. Launch the software.

*If the update is interrupted by any means (e.g. power off), it can resume the update by reading the update progress log.*

==Downloader==
1. Check if there is any update for the patches catalog available. If there isn't any, finish checking.
2. Download the updated catalog.
3. Determine the minimum size of patches to download to update the software to highest possible version. If there isn't any patch to download, finish checking.
4. Download available patches. Determine if there is any partly downlaoded patches and do resume download.
5. Validate the file size and checksum of the patches. If any failed, download the patch again until 5 times reached.
6. Record the downloaded patches in the client script.
7. Finished.
